## Shopping List Version 1.02

To start my adventure in learning react, I first implemented a button on my login screen that when clicked would display text. Doing this helped me to understand the structure of jsx files and how to properly implement them. After become more comfortable with jsx, I added a rate feature to the bottom of my shopping list page. It currently does not do anything but thank the user for rating my website. The point of making the rate system was to be able to implement multiple buttons with react that would all do something when clicked. After developing that, I moved on to create a button that would convert the total price from USD to Euro and vice versa. The challenge with this section was being able to display separate pieces of data in the same field, while also allowing the button to stay there for the user to be able to use as many times as they wanted. I learned more about states, and implemented that in my next feature, which was changing the color of the text in the table. I used a similar process, but it felt a bit more complicated as I had to take the table from the HTML and make it work in the jsx file. The new technology both hindered and improved my development experience. There was a bit of a learning curve for me initially when trying to learn about react and jsx, but after using it for a bit, I was able to understand what exactly react and jsx was, and could do some cool things with it (such as changing color of objects on the screen with a click). The front end of my web application definitely has improvemed.

Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.
